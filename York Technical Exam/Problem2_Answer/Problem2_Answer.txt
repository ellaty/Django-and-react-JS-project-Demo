Hardware requirement:: Camera , PC

Assumptions:
============
There is enough lighting for the camera to take relatively good image
(good enough to be still visible when you turn the image into grayscale).
The camera is capturing thee whole object not only a part of it.
(this can be one object or many but each one is taken entirely)

Case1. Are the object going to be in one place? Yes

classes:
=============
1.Camera class:
this class represent the camera in the system.
important methods: 
CaptureImage(){logic to take an image,
create a new image to hold the image data
 and saves the image in our database.}

we can use our own image class or rely on the exising classes.

2.Image class:
Represent the image taken by the camera( the one containing objects that need to be recognized)


3.RepresentedObject class: 
This class represent recognized object.
It is going to help us store information about a recognized object in the database.

attributes:

it has attributes that define an object.
how many sides that this image have,
(how high is the higest side), how wide is the widest side) thinking in term of a rectangle(with and height),
and what is the ratio between its highest and its widest side(or simply the ratio between the hight and the width of its bounding rectangle)
color of the image and the time when the image was taken and the shape

4.ImageProcessor: 
Has processImageMethod(takes in an image){
calls different arleadyexisting image processing libraries (eg:OpenCV in python) to 
do analysis on the captured image to find out needed information to create an image object and identify its shape.
Saves the identified object in the database using tje RepresentedObject class.
}

5.Dashbord:

To present all the information to the user in the needed format


2. Are object moving and passing in front of the camera?Yes
Hardware requirement:: Camera , PC, motion sensor.

Same classes as in the first scenario, but we need a motion sensor so we can know when the obeject is here and
call the capture image method of the camera class.

3.Are the objects moving and not passing in front of the camera (moving in a distant place with a lot of motion noise)Yes
Hardware requirement:: Camera , PC, motion sensor.
Sme logic as in the first scenario, but schedule the camera on when to take capture images(eg: everysecond, or everyminute)
