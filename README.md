# Django and React JS project Demo

In this project the back end is develloped in dango, and the front end is develloped using React JS
In this project, I have analyzed data collected y different manufacturing robots and built a user interface so I can present that data in human readable form.
Also I provide a way to upload new data files from the robots into the system.
I analyze it and store the findings in the database...., pull the from the database to the user interface.
there is also an option to search the data , with date or with other criterias
